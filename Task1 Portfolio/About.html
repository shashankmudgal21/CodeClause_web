          I am Shashank mudgal and I put up in Gwalior with my family my mother
          and father. I have pursued BTech in Computer Science Engineering from
          Jaypee university of engineering and technology. Since my school days,
          I'm a very brilliant student and i secured 85% in 10th and 83% in 12th
          and also I have been quite passionate about computers science and
          development and always wanted to work on live switches. Talking about
          my hobbies and interests, I love playing cricket and I was the sports
          captain in my school. We have won quite a lot of inter-school and
          inter-state tournaments in cricket and have brought laurels to the
          school.
